# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-01

- GitHub private marketplace authentication via Device Flow (RFC 8628). On first access to a private GitHub marketplace, Pi shows a one-time code and verification URL via `ctx.ui.notify`; the user authorizes from any browser. Subsequent add/update reuse the stored token silently via `git credential fill`.
- Credentials stored in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux gnome-keyring) via `git credential approve`. No token ever appears in state.json, error messages, or UI output.
- Git Credential Manager users: `GCM_INTERACTIVE=never` ensures Pi's own Device Flow UI is used instead of GCM's browser flow.
- Stale token automatically evicted via `git credential reject` and Device Flow re-triggered on auth failure.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-31

- Overhauled operation output: all commands now use a consistent marketplace-header + indented-plugin-rows format with status tokens, cause chains, and soft-dependency markers.
- The `/reload to pick up changes` hint now only appears when a Pi-visible resource actually changed (no more spurious hints on read-only or no-op operations).
- Benign no-ops (already up-to-date, idempotent autoupdate flips) render as dim status text instead of yellow Warning: output.
- `update <plugin>@<marketplace>` for a plugin not in the manifest now reports `(failed) {not in manifest}` matching `install`'s behavior, instead of the misleading `(skipped) {not installed}`.
- Autoupdate surface: `<autoupdate>` / `<no autoupdate>` marker tokens; `marketplace update` no-op renders `(skipped) {up-to-date}`.
- Hash-version plugins display as `v#abc1234` (git short SHA) instead of `vhash-2ea95f85703d`; plugin.json declared versions take precedence over content hashes.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-16

- Added `/claude:plugin reinstall` command: re-stages an installed plugin from its cached marketplace manifest without touching the network or changing the recorded version. Supports `reinstall <plugin>@<marketplace>`, `reinstall @<marketplace>`, bare `reinstall`, `--scope user|project`, and `--force` for plugins whose previous agent files were manually edited. Failure preserves the previous installed plugin, resources, and data directory; the plugin data directory is cleaned up only after the replacement and state commit succeed.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-16

- Added convenience `import` command to install marketplaces and plugins defined in the Claude Code configuration.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-16

- Added `/claude:plugin bootstrap` command: one-shot setup of the official Anthropic marketplace (`anthropics/claude-plugins-official`) in user scope with autoupdate enabled. Idempotent -- safe to re-run.
- Model specifications in plugin agent manifests are ignored unless the `--map-models` option is used when installing or updatinga plugin.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-15

- Clearer marketplace/plugin scoping rules.
- Completion on `/claude:plugin install` is limited to available plugins.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-15

- Fixed user-scope path resolution to honor Pi's agent home override.
- Updated the demo recording to use an isolated Pi home.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-13

- Lowered Node.js engine requirement to `>=20.19.0` and downgraded `write-file-atomic` to v7 for broader compatibility.
- Updated project branding images (SVG/PNG).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-13

- Moved @mariozechner packages to @earendil-works packages.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-12

- Initial release of `pi-claude-marketplace`.
- Supports four Claude plugin component types in Pi: skills, commands, agents, and MCP servers.
